# Depth-Varied Filters

Apply filters to image using depth map to vary intensity.

## Requirements

* Python 2.7+
* OpenCV with Python support
* Numpy

## Inspiration

This originated as a project for the Computational Photography Spring '15 at Georgia Tech. I was inspired by the Google Camera for Android Lens Blur feature and thought: "Blur is pretty cool. What would other filters look like?"

## Future Ideas

- apply multiple filters
- smooth blending between layers (Gaussian blending)
- add plane selector for z-origin
- additional filters
